# LatinSay - Flashcards for Latin Proverbs

Me and a friend decided to start studying Latin proverbs together. This application helps us learn Latin sayings using flashcards with a smart learning system.

## Features

- **Smart Learning System**: Cards you find challenging appear more frequently based on how long you spend studying them

## How the Learning System Works

The app uses an adaptive learning algorithm that:

1. **Measures Difficulty**: Tracks how long you spend on each card before flipping it
2. **Prioritizes Hard Cards**: Shows cards that take longer to learn more frequently
3. **Tracks Progress**: Maintains statistics on your learning journey
4. **Adapts to You**: The more you use the app, the better it understands what you need to practice
